The NAO Puppet Master (PUMA) allows you to control the NAO Robot using input devices like joysticks and game pads. 

You can make NAO say predefined or manually specified texts. It's possible to execute complex behaviors and as well to command the robot like a puppet.


Project Status:
--------------
The project is in a early alpha state and completely work-in-progress. The framework is (mostly) done and some NAO operations  as well. 

I'm currently working with a Saitek X52 Pro device for input. 


The application is built in 3 parts:
------------------------------------
1) A behavior that allows to run complex operations and which is remote-controlled by the server. The behavior runs on the robot and uses Choregraphe scripting and Python. The current version just "says" the requested operations in order to avoid NAO hopping around during development.

2) A TCP/IP server that acts as proxy between the regular MFC Windows application and the NAO robot. It is written in 'flat' C++ and built using the qiBuild framework. The commands are text-based, so you can use a telnet application instead of the MFC client to test. 

3) An MFC C++ application managing the interface with the user, the PUMA server and the gaming devices.


Note:
-----
The project shows different approaches like making 'qibuild' projects, accessing the NAO using C++, reading joysticks, controling Choregraphe/Python behaviors remotely etc. It can serve as inspiration for other NAO developers. The server can easily be re-used to work in other projects.
